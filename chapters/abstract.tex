Increasing an organisms' tolerance level to various stress conditions is one of the most common applications of adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) experiments which provides high amounts of genomic and experimental data that usually requires interdisciplinary research to analyze.

This study integrates enzyme kinetics and expression profiles of multiple \emph{S. cerevisiae} strains that have evolved in 8 stress conditions, ethanol, caffeine, coniferylaldehyde, iron, nickel, phenylethanol, and silver, into the genome-scale metabolic model of yeast to simulate evolved strains' behaviors. Traditional analyses such as FBA, FVA, MOMA, PhPP, robustness, survivability, sensitivity, and random sampling are conducted to identify most common and divergent points in the cellular metabolism. Reconstructed models were able to simulate batch conditions where the efficient protein allocation is the main goal for cells in order to survive under stressful environments. Simulation results were investigated both individually and comparatively, in both small-scale and large scale. The most common and varying targets of reactions, metabolites and enzymes that are assumed to be responsible for the adaptation mechanics were identified and discussed across mutant strains.

The study presented here successfully utilized genome-scale metabolic modelling techniques ALE experiments' data while providing a systematic view on the general yeast metabolism.
