Results section is not updated after GECKO integration! Since the method changes frequently, below figures and texts are not updated and they only give the idea about what is going to be in the final thesis.

\section{Chemostat Simulation: GAM Fitting}
In order to make sure the \emph{in-silico} obtained growth rate predictions are in agreement with the physiological kinetic parameters obtained from real experiments, fine adjustment on the energy reactions is a requirement. Since the growth-associated maintenance (GAM) and non-growth associated maintenance (NGAM) energy reactions play a determinant role in simulations, fluxes through these reactions must be constrained to a fixed value. Flux of NGAM is constrained to 0.7 mmol gDWh\textsuperscript{-1} for aerobic, and 0 mmol gDWh\textsuperscript{-1} for anaerobic simulations as calculated in the previous studies \cite{nilsson2016metabolic}. For the estimation of GAM, since it depends on the biomass composition, findings of a chemostat experiment  \cite{van1998effect} is used as a guide to fit predictions to. Model is simulated iteratively with a range of values for GAM, and the best fit is found at the level of 55.25 mmol gDWh\textsuperscript{-1} (Figure \ref{fig:Gam_fitting}), GAM flux is constrained accordingly.

\section{Flux Variability Analysis}
Flux variabilites of Yeast8 reactions are analyzed by solving the linear problem with the objective functions to minimize and maximize all reactions iteratively with tolerance value of 1e-9 using the GUROBI solver. Minimum and maximum available fluxes are collected in the iterative process for each reaction, and results are plotted for glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and TCA pathway reactions as error boxes (Figure \ref{fig:fva}). Flux values obtained through the ordinary FBA solution are also shown as a line.
