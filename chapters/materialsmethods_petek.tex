\section{Model Selection}
iAN50 \cite{nilsson2016metabolic}, a stoichiometric model of intermediary metabolism including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), anaerobic excretion, citric acid cycle (TCA cycle), oxidative phosphorylation, and uptake pathways for galactose, ethanol and acetate is used to simulate batch conditions. The model was implemented based on the first GSMM of yeast, iFF708 \cite{forster2003genome} with the addition of the yeast intermediary metabolism from the RAVEN toolbox \cite{agren2013raven}, and finally curated using the KEGG database \cite{kanehisa2000kegg}.

Biomass equation (Eq. \ref{eq:model_biomass}) in the model was left as a function of sub-reactions, for example protein, lipid, DNA synthesis reactions, so that the coefficients of biomass constituents could be optimized for each FBA simulation.
\begin{multline}
  0.5185\ \textrm{Glycogen} + 0.0234\ \textrm{Trehalose} + 0.8079\ \textrm{Mannan} + 1.1348\ \textrm{Glucan} \\
  + 0.1966\ \textrm{DNA} + 0.012\ \textrm{DNA} +  4.14\ \textrm{Protein} + 0.0269\ \textrm{Lipid} + 35.3630 \ \textrm{Maintainance} \\
  = \textrm{BIOMASS}
   \label{eq:model_biomass}
\end{multline}

Enzymatic reactions that are found in the model is collected in Table \ref{table:rxns_smallYeast}. In contrast to other GSMM's, each reaction was irreversible in the iAN50. This was achieved by splitting each reversible reaction into two seperate reactions in both directions.

Another reason to select iAN50 is that the total masses of enzymes catalyzing reactions in the GSMM were already estimated, and fluxes through these reactions were constrained to the biologic level, using an approach similar to intracellular crowding method using kinetic parameters \cite{beg2007intracellular, adadi2012prediction}. To clarify the method briefly, a flux value for each reaction was obtained by applying a standart flux balance analysis, and this value was divided by the maximum \emph{in vitro} activity collected from the enzyme database BRENDA \cite{schomburg2012brenda}, and a saturation factor of 0.5 (half) for simplification. Therefore, the mass of the enzymes required for that particular reaction was estimated and the constrains are applied to the corresponding enzymatic reactions.

\section{Flux Balance Analysis}
Uptake reaction of glucose with the secretion reactions of glycerol and acetate were constrained according to the calculated flux values in Table \ref{table:calculated_fluxes}, for both time intervals seperately. Since the main goal was to validate model for experimental conditions, ethanol was not constrained in regard to be used as the control metabolite. Experiments were done in fully aerobic conditions, therefore oxygen uptake reaction was set unlimited.


For the linear optimization, an implementation of parsimonious FBA (pFBA) from the reference publication was performed \cite{nilsson2016metabolic, AvlantGithub}. After solving the system using a linear solver, GUROBI, with the objective maximizing growth, the solution was used as a constraint. From that point, a second optimization was run to minimize the sum of all other fluxes.

\section{Visualization of the Model}
The GSMM was visualized in Cytoscape \cite{cline2007integration} using the Fluxviz plug-in \cite{konig2010fluxviz} and the solution fluxes were mapped onto edges. Network was imported in SBML \cite{hucka2018systems} and the flux distributions were imported in XML format prepared according to the plug-ins guide.
