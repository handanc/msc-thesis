\chapter{EXPANDABLE TOPICS}

\section{Following will be added into introduction}
Evolution of yeasts (bakers, brewers, wine etc.), strain engineering of S cerevisiae, other mathematical modelling methods, toolboxes (such as COBRA, RAVEN or other softwares and algorithms), FBA methods (pFBA, dFBA, TFBA, TEX-FBA etc), maybe detailed info on linear vs quadratic programming (how to solve?), thermodynamics (physicochemical background on reversibility), omics data (subtopics for each omics technology, integration methods of omics), databases in the literature, -for the results, if available- phylogenetic analysis of used strains to compare with evolutionary models (maybe distance matrix of flux distrubutions can be used to draw??), metabolic control analysis....
